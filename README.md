Group project

Our project targets to develop a detection and classification system to accurately detect malaria disease present in images of thin blood smears. To do so we have used different malaria cell images some of which are parasitized and some uninfected and we created a convolutional neural network using tensorflow and keras which is able to classify weteher the cells are infected or not. 

This is very a very important problem nowadays as the detection of malaria is slow and most of the most infected countries do not have the necessary resources to properly detect it so our aim is to help with this issue and try to find a way which makes the process easier and quicker an which is as accurate as possible.
